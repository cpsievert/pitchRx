  	CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 1.0

MAJOR CHANGES

  - scrapeFX() is now deprecated. Please use the scrape() function instead. The function is built upon the R package XML2R. This change will lead to many improvements:

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS

    (1) Easily write tables to a remote database using scrape()'s connect argument. This will lead to both better memory management and faster run-time.
    (2) Query particular game(s) of interest using the game.ids option.
    (3) Much, much easier to maintain and add support for new file types. scrape() currently supports four types of files: inning_all.xml, inning_hit.xml, miniscoreboard.xml, and players.xml. 
    (4) pitchRx will serve as a nice example of using the XML2R framework to build web scrapers. One example is the bbscrapeR package -- https://github.com/cpsievert/bbscrapeR
    (5) The memory hog data(urls) is no longer included. Instead, Gameday IDs - data(gids) - will help drive the construction of urls. Also, data(fields) are now used as the "master" list of fields to when writing tables to database.
    (6) "Average" users should still find scrape() very easy to use.
    (7) Better management of variable types.

MINOR CHANGES

  - The variable "top_inning" in the "atbat" table was changed to "inning_side" and will now contain values of "top" or "bottom" (instead of "Y" or "N").

  - The default value for the limitz opiton for strikeFX was changed from c(-2.5, 2.5, 0, 5) to c(-2, 2, 0.5, 4.5). This eliminates some un-interesting white-space in many cases.

  - geom="ggsubplot" is working again now that CRAN is happy with the ggsubplot package.

MINOR FIXES

  - More robust handling of model option in strikeFX. Also, added informative messages to let user know about conditioning.

    CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 0.7

MAJOR CHANGES

   - Markdown vignette was removed since R2SWF was removed from CRAN and there doesn't seem to be a great alternative currently. The vignette may re-appear in future versions, but you can still go to the demo page - http://cpsievert.github.io/pitchRx/demo/

  - The model option of strikeFX is now restricted to "gam" objects (see ?mgcv::gamObject). One can now pass either a fitted gam object or a function call to mgcv::gam or mgcv::bam. When passing a function call, strikeFX will automatically save the model object to the working directory. It's important to note that any variables used in a ggplot2 facet layer or in the density1/density2 options MUST BE INCLUDED as factors in the model. 

  - geom="ggsubplot" is no longer a valid geometry option since the ggsubplot package was archived on CRAN. 

MINOR FIXES

  - In the pitches dataset, the variables "px", "pz", "x0", "y0", "z0", "vx0", "vy0", "vz0", "ax", "ay", "az" are now numeric variables.

  - scrapeFX changes the "des" field in the "atbat" tables to "atbat_des" to avoid conflicts with the "des" field in the "pitch" table.

    CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 0.6

MAJOR CHANGES

   - Better namespace handling. The package no longer depends, but instead imports the following packages: MASS, rgl, mgcv, hexbin, lubridate, stringr, plyr, reshape.

NEW FEATURES

	- avg.by option now available for interactiveFX

MINOR FIXES

	- When passing a model to strikeFX, a white strike-zone is now drawn (if it isn't a differenced density)

	- In animateFX, if the color variable is a factor, the original ordering of levels will be preserved.

		CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 0.5

MAJOR CHANGES

   - point.size is no longer supported in animateFX. Point size is now governed by distance from home plate (they will get larger as they progress toward home plate).

   - Default values for the start and end options of scrapeFX were removed. The user must specify dates.

   - Default value for adjust option in strikeFX was changed to FALSE to avoid confusing the user by adjusting vertically locations without specifying so.

NEW FEATURES

   - the model option allows one to create probabilistic strike-zone densities as opposed a "raw" strike-zone density. See the strikeFX example page for an example using mgcv::gam.

   - the avg.by option allows one to average over PITCHf/x parameters for a given discrete variable (note that any faceting variables will be included in the index). That is, the average PITCHf/x parameters are plotted for every unique combination of facet and avg.by variable(s).

DOCUMENTATION

    - Documentation of non-exported functions was removed.

		CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 0.4

NEW FEATURES
   
    - HTML vignette now available.

    - strikeFX has a new geom="subplot2d" option.


		CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 0.3

NEW FEATURES
   
    - The data(urls) object is now updated to include 2013 urls.

   - The function updateUrls() is now exported so that users can collect urls that are not already provided in data(urls).

		CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

   - see here for a comprehensive tutorial: http://cpsievert.github.com/pitchRx/demo

   - 3D plots of pitch trajectories are now available through interactiveFX(). Note that spheres==TRUE employs basic rgl::spheres3d functionality; otherwise rgl::plot3d is used


		CHANGES IN pitchRx VERSION 0.1

NEW FEATURES

  - first version of pitchRx.
